### Naming and Organizational Conventions  

We followed accepted Java naming conventions when naming our tests to reflect the function they served to test.
Due to the use of Java, we had one class for the suite of JUnit tests, then constructed a second class to perform
the functions required by the prompt.

### Setup and Execution Instructions  

The following are needed in order to properly run this program and the unit tests associated with it.  
[Java SE Development Kit 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)  
[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/2018-12/)  
[JUnit4](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install)  
[EclEmma](https://www.eclemma.org/)  

All of the pieces of software presented above working in unison allows a user to access the offered functions, see that
a suite of JUnit tests serve as docuementation for functionality, and verify the code coverage put forth in this report.
To access function use, the user would run our main.java file in their Eclipse IDE, and answer the questions put forth
by the console. To access the suite of tests, the user would run mainTest.java to see all of the tests pass. EclEmma is 
the plug-in for Eclipse that grants access to comprehensive code coverage reports, and can be seen by pressing the button
directly to the right of the usual run button.

### Test Coverage Report  
This is the test coverage report for our unit tests. All of our functions and tests reached above the minimum 85% coverage.

### Timothy's Unit Testing & TDD Experience  

My personal experience with unit testing and TDD was overall a good one, but sometimes consisted of frustration at not
moving as efficiently as I believe it could be. It felt like if I began by addressing the tests I would make as I created 
my functions, rather than needing to lay them all out before writing any code, the two different aspects could have fed off 
of each other and led to more cohesion. I think it's extremely useful for a project to spend an explicit amount of time
laying out requirements and expectations. There can be no discipline without direction of knowing which way you wish to go,
and communicating clearly about what is expected surely ends in a better result. In short, I think TDD helps to flesh out 
specifications, but is a hinderance when it treated as a requirement before delving into functionality.
